## Project description

A national, observational cohort study from 1, July 2020, to August 31, 2023, using English population-linked electronic health records. We identified 45,203 children under 18 years old in whom SARS-CoV-2 either caused or contributed to hospitalization, excluding those admitted with “incidental” infection. Studied outcomes were types of hospitalization and severe hospitalizations involving either critical care or PIMS-TS.
